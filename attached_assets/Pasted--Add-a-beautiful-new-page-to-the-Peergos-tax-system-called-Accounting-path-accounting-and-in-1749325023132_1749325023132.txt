✨ Add a beautiful new page to the Peergos tax system called "Accounting" (path: /accounting), and include it in the sidebar between "VAT" and "Financials".

This page must follow Apple-style aesthetics: clean layout, extra padding, large readable fonts, xl-rounded cards, smart iconography, and perfect mobile responsiveness.

🎯 Page Goal: Let UAE SMEs record revenues, expenses, and auto-generate VAT-compliant invoices — with zero accounting knowledge.
